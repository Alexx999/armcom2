In the **Main Menu**, you can continue a previously saved campaign, start a new campaign, change game options, or quit the game.

To **Continue** a campaign, it must have been saved with a compatible version of the game. If the first two version numbers match, it will be compatible. Otherwise you won't be able to resume your campaign.

If you start a **New Campaign**, any current saved campaign will be erased. You can only have one saved campaign at any one time.

**Game Options** can be accessed here and from the in-game menu as well. Changing the **Font Size** will change the total window size. **Sound Effects**, including the main menu theme, can be toggled here. **Message Pause** changes the length of time that pop-up messages are displayed before disappearing. Several **Keyboard** layouts are supported, and you can set your own keyboard mapping by editing the "custom" dictionary in the keyboard_mapping.json file in the data folder, and selecting it here.
