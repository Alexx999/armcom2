In the **Main Menu**, you can continue a previously saved game, start a new game, change game options, or quit the game.

To **Continue** a game, it must have been saved with a compatible version of the game. If the first two version numbers match, it will be compatible. Otherwise you won't be able to resume your game.

If you **Start a New Game**, any current saved game will be erased. You can only have one saved game at any one time.

**Game Options** can be accessed here and from the in-game menu as well. Changing the **Font Size** will change the total window size. **Sound Effects**, including the main menu theme, can be toggled here. **Message Pause** changes the length of time that pop-up messages are displayed before disappearing. Several **Keyboard** layouts are supported, and you can set your own keyboard mapping by editing the "custom" dictionary in the keyboard_mapping.json file in the data folder, and selecting it here.
