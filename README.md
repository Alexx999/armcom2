To run armcom2.py, you will need:

* Python 2.7.8	http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/
* Libtcod 1.5.1	http://bitbucket.org/libtcod/libtcod
* PyGame 1.9.1	http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
* XPLoader	http://github.com/RCIX/XPLoader

Note that since this is still a Proof of Concept, there's no versioning, so this version will be replaced eventually until the game is developed enough to start an Alpha series.
